![Mundi open-source web GIS](../../assets/social.png)

[Mundi](https://github.com/BuntingLabs/mundi.ai) is an open source, AI-native GIS. Mundi is available on our hosted cloud service at [app.mundi.ai](https://app.mundi.ai)
and is self-hostable under the AGPLv3 license. Give us a [star on GitHub](https://github.com/BuntingLabs/mundi.ai),
[join our Discord to talk to us](https://discord.gg/V63VbgH8dT), or
[create a pull request](https://github.com/BuntingLabs/mundi.ai/pulls) to contribute back!

import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Starting on Mundi cloud

You can sign up for free at [app.mundi.ai](https://app.mundi.ai) to try out Mundi.

We have a set of guides that walk through sample use cases of Mundi. I recommend ["Making your first map"](/getting-started/making-your-first-map)
as a starter tutorial.

## Self-hosting Mundi

Mundi is open source (AGPLv3) and can run entirely on your local machine with local LLMs.

We have a [tutorial on self-hosting Mundi](/deployments/self-hosting-mundi). Self-hosting requires
a good computer/server, git, and Docker. You can optionally connect it to a local LLM (or any
provider that supports the chat completions API).
